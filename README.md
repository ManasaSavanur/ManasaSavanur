# Hi, I'm Manasa Savanur 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Data Scientist & Analytics Engineer. 

In my 9-5, I build financial data models, data pipelines to support them, and design dashboards that provide self-service analytics to senior management.
I am a certified Financial Risk Manager(FRM) and I can talk business.

In my personal projects, I love experimenting with different data structures and dashboard alternatives (Gotta make it look pretty!)
