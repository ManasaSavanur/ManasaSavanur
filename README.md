# Hi, I'm Manasa Savanur 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Data Scientist & Analytics Engineer. 

In my 9-5, I build financial data models, data pipelines to support them and analytic platforms to provide self-service analytics to senior management. I like to use Python - Airflow - PosetgreSQL - Github - Copilot - Power BI. 

In my personal projects, I love experimenting with different data structures and dashboard alternatives (That's how I play dress-up with data)
